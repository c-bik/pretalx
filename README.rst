pretalx + live online conferences
---------------------------------

This is a temporary fork of ``pretalx`` ( https://github.com/pretalx/pretalx/ ),
trying to extend it to **live, online conferences**.

Some high-level ideas were prepared there, before we decided to base our effort
on pretalx:

Hackathon
---------

The issue tracker here ( https://github.com/ThomasWaldmann/pretalx/issues )
should be rather for very specific, close-to-the-code todo and issues.

Read the issues, so we do not need to repeat.

Our live installation (`vcc` branch): https://yourexhibit.o4b.ch/

Jitsi: https://meet.jit.si/YourExhibit (audio conferences)

Slack: https://app.slack.com/client/T0106J3DAGZ/C010VMN6C8G/thread/C010VMN6C8G-1585342620.039500

Django developers to add some new app / views, basic templates.

Frontend people who enhance templates, html, css to make it look nice, have good UI/UX.
